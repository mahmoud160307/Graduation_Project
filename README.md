# Graduation_project
Graduaiton project focus on disasters detection in the industrial field using IoT and machine learning.
Disasters like fire,oil and gas leakage. We solve three cases with "machine learning - Deep Learning"algorithms like "Yolov3-CNN"and IoT.
we change the standard Yolov3 algorithm to work for our cases and create our own DataSet in case of oil leakage. 
Also,we use IoT in case of gas to provide best effective solution. 
Finally evaluating each approach and cases results to be effective and easy to use.
